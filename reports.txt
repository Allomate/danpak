Reporting:

1- MTD Sale Amount:
SELECT SUM(final_price) from order_contents
where order_id IN (SELECT id FROM `orders` where MONTH(created_at) = 7 and LOWER(status) = 'completed')

2- Sales Target achievement:
Delayed as asked by Wakas Bhai

3- Target Deficit (Amount) - To a specific employee:
Delayed as asked by Wakas Bhai

4- Projected MTD Sales (For Current Month):
    My Formula
    a- Daily Average Sales (My Formula):
